<!-- Having struggled with understanding how the Spotify OAuth flow works, I made the course I wish I could have had.

Unlike tutorials that only cover a few concepts and leave you with half-baked GitHub repositories, this course covers everything from explaining the principles of REST APIs to implementing Spotify's OAuth flow and fetching API data in a React app. By the end of the course, youâ€™ll have an app deployed to the internet you can add to your portfolio. -->

This is a paid client project for a local organic farmer in Taiwan.
The goal is to create a landing page for client's customers to find out about their products and links to other online store channels, such as LINE Store, Google Maps, Youtube, etc.

<!-- #### Designs
The website is design to work as a info page for customers to understand more about what the client is doing and along with what their main selling products are. Since the client usually contact the customer via messaging app, this website serves as a useful demo site for providing customers with the necessary info (such as location, how to contact, etc.)
