As a team of 5, worked to create a webapp within 1 week aimed at teaching people to learn different language.

Each page shows "4 squares" with pictures, and user has to click the correct picture that correspond to the given language description they are learning. 

Incorporated social network API (ex: Facebook) and interface so users can share result online.
